  description: ServiceNow is a cloud platform for digital workflow automation that helps organizations deliver and manage services across IT, employees, and customers. It centralizes requests, incidents, changes, and assets in a single system of record, anchored by a configuration management database that maps services and dependencies. Core offerings span IT service and operations management, asset and software management, security operations and risk/compliance, HR service delivery, customer and field service, and industry solutions. The platform provides low-code tools to build apps and flows, Integration Hub and RPA to connect external systems, and AI features like virtual agents and Now Assist to deflect tickets and speed resolution. Organizations use ServiceNow to standardize processes, provide self-service portals, monitor and remediate issues across hybrid infrastructure, and orchestrate end-to-end workflows across departments—resulting in faster cycle times, better visibility and
    compliance, and improved employee and customer experiences.

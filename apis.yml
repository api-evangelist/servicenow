      ServiceNow is a cloud platform for digital workflow automation that helps
      organizations deliver and manage services across IT, employees, and
      customers. It centralizes requests, incidents, changes, and assets in a
      single system of record, anchored by a configuration management database
      that maps services and dependencies. Core offerings span IT service and
      operations management, asset and software management, security operations
      and risk/compliance, HR service delivery, customer and field service, and
      industry solutions. The platform provides low-code tools to build apps and
      flows, Integration Hub and RPA to connect external systems, and AI
      features like virtual agents and Now Assist to deflect tickets and speed
      resolution. Organizations use ServiceNow to standardize processes, provide
      self-service portals, monitor and remediate issues across hybrid
      infrastructure, and orchestrate end-to-end workflows across
      departments—resulting in faster cycle times, better visibility and
      compliance, and improved employee and customer experiences.

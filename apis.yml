      API to manage ticket information between external ticketing systems and

      The Contact API provides endpoints that enable you to retrieve and update
      Customer Service Management (CSM) contact records. In addition, you can
      generate new social media profile records when creating a contact. The
      Contact API requires the Customer Service plugin (com.sn_customerservice)
      and is provided within the now namespace. Users need the
      csm_ws_integration role for full API access.
